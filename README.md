# LaC.CostSet ‚Äî Personal Inventory as Code for Obsidian

Manage your belongings as structured TOML-in-Markdown inside Obsidian. Track price, purchase/end dates, tags, and optional recycle value. Explore daily cost trends, filter by tags, search, sort, and add/edit items with a clean UI.

![Demo](docs/demo.png)

## What this plugin does

- **Open a dedicated view for an inventory entry file** and render your items as cards with totals and a cost trend chart.
- **Generate a sample entry + sample items on first run** if the configured entry file does not exist.
- **Read/write items as TOML** (with comments preserved). Wikilinks like `[[ItemName]]` are supported inside Markdown; the plugin quotes them only temporarily for parsing.
- **Filter, search, sort**: filter by tags, search by name/tags, sort by daily cost / price / purchase date.
- **Add/edit/delete items** in place. Long-press a card to temporarily toggle hidden (not persisted).
- **Local-first**: All data stays inside your vault.

## How to open the view

- Command palette: run "Open LaC.CostSet" (command id: `open-lac-costset`). The plugin will use the configured entry file (see Settings) and create a sample if missing.
- File context menu: right-click a Markdown file and choose "Open with LaC.CostSet" to use that file as the entry (enable this in Settings).

> The view type is `lac-costset-view`. On startup the plugin avoids auto-restoring this view to keep your layout clean.

## Entry file format (required)

The entry file is a Markdown file whose content must satisfy a minimal TOML header plus a body of wikilinks to item files.

Minimal example:

```toml
# Top TOML must include
type = "root"
renders = ["costset"]

# Body: list asset filenames using wikilinks (no extension)

[[Keyboard]]
[[Headphones]]
```

Notes:
- The file extension can be `.md`.
- Lines starting with `#` are comments and will be preserved.
- Wikilinks in the body can be unquoted; the plugin quotes them only for TOML parsing internally.

## Item note format (TOML)

You can use either the flat schema or the namespaced schema. Both are supported on read; on save the plugin rewrites only the costset-related keys and preserves leading comments.

Flat schema (default emit on new files):

```toml
name = "Thinkbook14p2025"

[style]
icon = "üíª"

[detail]
price = 7999
active_from = "2023-01-01"
active_to = ""
recycle_price = 1200
tags = ["computer", "work"]
```

Namespaced schema (also accepted):

```toml
[costset]
name = "Thinkbook14p2025"
hidden = false

[costset.style]
icon = "üíª"

[costset.detail]
price = 7999
active_from = "2023-01-01"
active_to = ""
recycle_price = 1200
tags = ["computer", "work"]
```

Daily cost is computed from `(price - recycle_price) / daysUsed` where `daysUsed` goes from `active_from` to the selected date (or `active_to` if it ended earlier). The trend chart treats `recycle_price` as `0` until the end date is reached.

## UI overview

- Top summary: total daily cost, total price, total recyclable value; tag chips to filter; date picker; cost trend chart with progressive refinement.
- Action bar: search box, sort button (daily cost / price / purchase date), add button.
- Item cards: name, dates, tags, daily cost, price, recycle price; click to edit; long-press to toggle hidden (in-memory); right-click to delete.

## Settings

- **Entry file**: path to the inventory entry Markdown file. Default: `costset/costset.md`.
- **Enable context menu**: show "Open with LaC.CostSet" in Markdown file context menu.
- **Default sort**: none (text order) | daily cost | price | purchase date.
- **Default icon**: one Emoji for new items. Only the first Emoji is kept when pasting text.
- **Language**: Auto / ‰∏≠Êñá / English. Currency symbol adapts: `¬•` for zh, `$` for en.

## Installation

1) Copy the plugin folder into `.obsidian/plugins/`.
2) Enable it in Settings ‚Üí Community plugins.

Optional (testing via BRAT): install the community plugin ‚ÄúBRAT‚Äù and add your repository to get auto-updates.

## Notes & limitations

- "Hidden" is a temporary per-view toggle for quick comparisons; it is not persisted to files.
- The plugin rewrites only fields related to costset (name, style.icon, detail.*) and keeps your leading comments.
